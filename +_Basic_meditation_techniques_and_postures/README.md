<p><strong>Understanding the Basics of Meditation</strong></p>

<p>Before we dive into the techniques and postures, it's essential to understand the basics of meditation. Meditation is a practice that involves training your mind to focus, relax, and become more aware of your thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations.
