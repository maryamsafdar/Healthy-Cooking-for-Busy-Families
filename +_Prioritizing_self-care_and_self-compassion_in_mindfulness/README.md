<p><strong>The Importance of Self-Care in Mindfulness</strong></p>

<p>Self-care is often misunderstood as a luxury or an indulgence, but it's a vital aspect of maintaining our overall well-being. When we prioritize self-care, we're not being selfish; we're being responsible. By taking care of our physical, emotional, and mental health, we create a solid foundation for our mindfulness practice.</p>

<p>In mindfulness, self-care is about cultivating awareness of our needs and taking intentional actions to meet them. This might involve:</p>
